# Hello-World
First Things First

Names Armois Delgato, fair slinger of mortgages and, well, code I assume.  Assuming I can learn such things, that is.  Undergrad wasn't technical, I'm afraid.  I had a strong aversion to work in the first few decades of life and now in my third it seems I need to make up for lost time.

I hope you are having a wondrous day- unless you are here on these fair internets illegally, in which case get out.
